# Hooks and Privacy

## Overview

UltraThink enforces a privacy-first stance through a hook system. Four shell-script hooks run at specific points in the workflow lifecycle to enforce security, persist memory, validate formatting, and dispatch notifications. All hooks live in `.claude/hooks/`.

The privacy hook is the most critical -- it checks every file access against blocked patterns before the access occurs, logging all decisions to an audit trail.

## The Four Hooks

### 1. Privacy Hook (`privacy-hook.sh`)

**Type**: Pre-tool hook (runs before file access)

**Purpose**: Checks file paths against `.ckignore` patterns and built-in blocklists. Blocks access to sensitive files and logs all decisions.

**Trigger**: Any file read or write operation.

**Behavior**:
1. Receives the target file path as argument `$1`
2. Resolves to absolute path
3. Checks allow overrides first (e.g., `.env.example`)
4. Checks built-in blocked patterns (always enforced)
5. Checks `.ckignore` user-defined patterns
6. Logs the decision to `reports/hook-events.jsonl`
7. Exits 0 (allowed) or exits 1 (blocked, with error message to stderr)

**Built-in Blocked Patterns** (always enforced, cannot be overridden):

| Pattern | Protects |
|---------|----------|
| `.env` | Environment variables |
| `.env.*` | Environment variable variants |
| `*.pem` | TLS/SSL certificates |
| `*.key` | Private keys |
| `*.p12`, `*.pfx` | PKCS#12 keystores |
| `*/credentials*` | Credential files |
| `*/secrets*` | Secret configuration |
| `*/tokens*` | Token storage |
| `*/.auth*` | Auth configuration |
| `*.keystore` | Java keystores |

**Built-in Allow Overrides** (these bypass blocks):

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `.env.example` | Template, no real secrets |
| `.env.template` | Template, no real secrets |
| `*.example.*` | Example files are safe |

**Log Format** (JSONL in `reports/hook-events.jsonl`):

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-02T10:30:00Z",
  "severity": "warning",
  "action": "blocked",
  "path": "/project/.env.production",
  "description": "Built-in pattern matched: .env.*"
}
```

### 2. Memory Save Hook (`memory-save.sh`)

**Type**: Post-session hook (runs after a session ends)

**Purpose**: Persists pending session memories to the Postgres database.

**Behavior**:
1. Checks for `DATABASE_URL` environment variable (tries loading from `.env` if not set)
2. Looks for pending memory files in the session temp directory (`/tmp/ultrathink-session/`)
3. Reads each `.memory.json` file, extracting `content`, `category`, `importance`, `scope`
4. Skips empty content files
5. Marks processed files as `.saved`
6. Logs the save operation to `reports/hook-events.jsonl`

**Memory File Format** (JSON in session temp directory):

```json
{
  "content": "React Server Components cannot use useState or useEffect",
  "category": "pattern",
  "importance": 7,
  "scope": "nextjs/frontend"
}
```

### 3. Format Check Hook (`format-check.sh`)

**Type**: Post-edit hook (runs after a file is modified)

**Purpose**: Validates and auto-fixes formatting of modified files.

**Supported File Types**:

| Extension | Check | Auto-fix |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| `ts`, `tsx`, `js`, `jsx`, `mjs`, `cjs` | Prettier format check | Yes (if Prettier available) |
| `json` | JSON syntax validation via `jq` | No (warns only) |
| `sql` | Manual review recommendation | No |
| `sh`, `bash`, `zsh` | Shell syntax check via `bash -n` | No (warns only) |
| `md` | Logs modification | No |

### 4. PreCompact State Preservation (`pre-compact.sh`)

**Type**: Pre-compact hook (runs before context window compression)

**Purpose**: Extracts critical session state from the transcript before compaction and injects it back as `additionalContext` so the compacted conversation retains continuity. Also saves state to `/tmp/ultrathink-compact-state/<session_id>.json` for session recovery.

**Trigger**: Context window approaching limits, before automatic compaction.

**What Gets Preserved**:

| Data | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Files modified | Edit/Write tool calls in transcript | Prevents re-reading files already seen |
| Last user request | Last user message (truncated to 500 chars) | Maintains task context |
| Key decisions | Pattern matching on assistant messages | Preserves rationale |
| Pending work | Pattern matching for TODO/next/remaining | Tracks incomplete work |
| Last progress update | Last assistant message (truncated to 400 chars) | Continuity signal |
| GSD progress | `/tmp/ultrathink-progress-<session>` | Wave/task completion state |
| Active agents | `/tmp/ultrathink-agents-<session>` | Running subagent states |

**Companion Script**: `pre-compact-extract.ts` parses the JSONL transcript to extract structured state. It uses regex patterns to identify decisions (`"decided to..."`, `"going with..."`) and pending work (`"still need to..."`, `"TODO"`, `"next:"`).

**Output**: Returns `{"additionalContext": "..."}` with preserved state so it survives compaction.

### 5. Subagent Verification (`subagent-verify.sh`)

**Type**: Post-tool hook (runs after Agent tool completes)

**Purpose**: Automatically verifies subagent deliverables after completion. Catches failures, missing files, and build errors before the orchestrator proceeds to dependent work.

**Trigger**: Any Agent tool completion (PostToolUse with Agent matcher).

**Checks Performed**:

| Check | Condition | What It Catches |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Error detection | Agent result contains "error", "failed", "STOP", "Rule 4" | Silent failures, architecture stops |
| Worktree changes | Agent used `isolation: "worktree"` | Agents that ran but produced nothing |
| Files exist | GSD `files_owned` metadata in plan files | Missing deliverables |
| TypeScript build | Workspace has `tsconfig.json` + agent touched `.ts`/`.tsx` | Type errors from subagent code |

**Output**: Returns `{"additionalContext": "Subagent verification: N/M checks passed"}` with issue details if any checks fail.

**Timeout**: 20 seconds (allows time for TypeScript compilation check).

### 6. Notification Hook (`notify.sh`)

**Type**: Event-driven hook (called explicitly by other hooks or skills)

**Purpose**: Dispatches notifications to configured channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack).

**Usage**:
```bash
./notify.sh <message> [channel] [priority]
```

**Parameters**:
- `message` (required): The notification text
- `channel` (optional): `telegram`, `discord`, `slack`, or `all` (default: `all`)
- `priority` (optional): `low`, `normal`, `high`, `critical` (default: `normal`)

**Priority Prefixes**:
- `critical` -> `[CRITICAL] UltraThink: <message>`
- `high` -> `[HIGH] UltraThink: <message>`
- `normal` -> `UltraThink: <message>`
- `low` -> `[low] UltraThink: <message>`

**Channel Configuration** (in `.claude/ck.json`):
```json
{
  "notifications": {
    "telegram": {
      "token": "bot-token-here",
      "chatId": "chat-id-here"
    },
    "discord": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
    "slack": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
  }
}
```

## Sensitivity Levels

Configured in `.claude/ck.json` under `privacyHook.sensitivityLevel`:

### `standard` (default)

- Block known secret patterns (the built-in list)
- Check `.ckignore` patterns
- Log all access events
- No prompts for normal project files

### `strict`

- Everything in `standard`
- Prompt for any file access outside the project root
- Block all external file reads without explicit approval
- Enhanced logging with full path context

### `paranoid`

- Everything in `strict`
- Prompt for ALL file reads, even within the project
- Block all network requests without explicit approval
- Full audit trail of every operation
- Recommended only for high-security environments

## Hook Event Logging

All hooks write events to `reports/hook-events.jsonl` in a consistent JSON format. The database also stores events in the `hook_events` table with additional fields:

### JSONL Format (file-based)

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-03-02T10:30:00Z","severity":"warning","action":"blocked","path":"/project/.env","description":"Built-in pattern matched: .env"}
```

### Database Format (`hook_events` table)

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | UUID | Unique event ID |
| `event_type` | VARCHAR(50) | `file_read`, `file_write`, `file_blocked`, `file_approved` |
| `severity` | VARCHAR(20) | `info`, `warning`, `critical` |
| `description` | TEXT | Human-readable description |
| `path_accessed` | TEXT | File path involved |
| `action_taken` | VARCHAR(50) | `allowed`, `blocked`, `prompted`, `approved`, `denied` |
| `hook_name` | VARCHAR(100) | Which hook generated this event |
| `session_id` | UUID | Session that triggered the event |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMPTZ | Event timestamp |

## The `.ckignore` File

The `.ckignore` file (at project root) defines custom blocked and allowed patterns for the privacy hook. It uses gitignore-like syntax. See [ckignore](./ckignore.md) for full format documentation.

Quick example:

```gitignore
# Block custom secrets
config/production.json
vault/**

# Allow specific overrides
!config/example.json
```

## Dashboard Integration
